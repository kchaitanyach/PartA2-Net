# From Points to Parts: 3D Object Detection from Point Cloud with Part-aware and Part-aggregation Network

This repository is for our TPAMI paper [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03670), please find  [[PointCloudDet3D]](https://github.com/sshaoshuai/PointCloudDet3D) for the official PyTorch implementation of our `Part-A^2 net`.

## Introduction
In this work, we propose the part-aware and aggregation neural network (PartA2-Net). The whole framework consists of the part-aware stage and the part-aggregation stage. Firstly, the part-aware stage for the first time fully utilizes free-of-charge part supervisions derived from 3D ground-truth boxes to simultaneously predict high quality 3D proposals and accurate intra-object part locations. The predicted intra-object part locations within the same proposal are grouped by our new-designed RoI-aware point cloud pooling module, which results in an effective representation to encode the geometry-specific features of each 3D proposal. Then the part-aggregation stage learns to re-score the box and refine the box location by exploring the spatial relationship of the pooled intra-object part locations. 
At the time of submission (July-9 2019), our PartA2-Net outperforms all existing 3D detection methods and achieves new state-of-the-art on KITTI 3D object detection [learderbaord](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/backups/2019_10_08_10_46_41_object_3d.html) by utilizing only the LiDAR point cloud data.
